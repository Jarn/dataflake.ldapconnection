 dataflake.ldapconnection
==========================

This package provides an abstraction layer on top of python-ldap. It
offers a connection object with simplified methods for inserting, 
modifying, searching and deleting records in the LDAP directory tree.
Failover/redundancy can be achieved by supplying connection data for 
more than one LDAP server.
